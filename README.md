# Brews Around the Bay

With assistance from Yelp's 3rd-party API, Bays Around the Bay caters to the weekend warriors by displaying local Bay Area favorites bars that are currently hosting a Happy Hour.The inspiration behind this application was to simply solve the problem of not knowing where to go with colleagues/friends after long days at the Coding Dojo bootcamp. Brews Around the Bay was built using React as the frontend JavaScript Library, Express & Node.js for backend support, MongoDB for the database, and the Yelp & Geolocation API's. The site was deployed with Heroku.
